Abstract
The Smart Urban Air Quality Monitoring System (SUAQMS) is designed to monitor and manage environmental quality in urban areas through the integration of IoT sensors, real-time analytics, and automated alerts. This final phase delivers a unified platform to track pollutants such as PM2.5, CO2, NOx, and VOCs while providing actionable insights through a centralized dashboard. The project leverages AI-based forecasting, geospatial mapping, and adaptive alert systems. This document outlines the full system lifecycle, including demonstration overviews, architecture diagrams, performance metrics, source code documentation, and testing outcomes. SUAQMS aims to improve public health, urban planning, and environmental awareness with scalable and efficient deployment.
